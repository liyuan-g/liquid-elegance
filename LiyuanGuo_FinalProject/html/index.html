        <h2 class="animated-title">Cocktails Through the Ages: A Journey of Flavor and Craft</h2>
        <p>Cocktails have a rich history that spans centuries, beginning in the early 19th century. Originally a simple mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters, the cocktail was first recognized as a distinct drink in the United States in the early 1800s. Over time, this iconic beverage evolved into a wide variety of flavors, techniques, and styles. From the elegance of the Martini to the boldness of the Old Fashioned, cocktails have become an integral part of social gatherings, celebrations, and evening relaxation.</p>
